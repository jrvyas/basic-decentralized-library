# 📚 Decentralized Library System

## 🌟 Project Vision

The Decentralized Library System is an innovative blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize traditional library management by leveraging the power of Ethereum smart contracts. Our goal is to create a transparent, secure, and decentralized library management system that empowers users and librarians alike.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Decentralized Book Management**: Books are tracked on the Ethereum blockchain
- **Transparent Ownership**: Clear tracking of book borrowing and return
- **Permissioned Access**: Librarian-only book addition
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web3 enabled frontend for easy interaction

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Web3 Library**: Ethers.js
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask

## 🌐 Deployment Details

### Smart Contract Addresses

**Testnets**:
- **Sepolia**: `0x...` (Pending Deployment)
- **Goerli**: `0x...` (Pending Deployment)

**Mainnet**:
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: `0x...` (Pending Deployment)

> **Note**: Replace the placeholder addresses with actual deployed contract addresses

## 🔮 Future Scope and Roadmap

### Short-Term Enhancements
1. **Advanced Book Tracking**
   - Add ISBN integration
   - Implement book condition tracking
   - Create detailed book history logs

2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Implement user registration

   - Enable inter-library book transfers
   - Develop cross-library borrowing mechanisms

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement late return penalty system
   - Create book recommendation algorithm
   - Add support for digital book lending

### Long-Term Vision
1. **Global Decentralized Library Network**
   - Create a worldwide, decentralized library ecosystem
   - Support multiple languages and regional adaptations
   - Integrate with global digital libraries
